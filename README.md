# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - PowerBI
# Problem statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective management decision-making, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide these insights.

Their revenue management team had hired a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Learnt things from this Project 

1. Learnt to build a new visual (Calendar visual) using a matrix table, which can be utilized for different purposes of analysis. 
2. By referring to different cancellation policies followed by different hotels, understand that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the 
   booking is cancelled before three months of the booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge ranges from 60 to 90% of the 
   booking cost.
3. Learnt, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and a clear filter button in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection.
4. Tried using color palette and sticking with that colors throughout the dashboard.
5. Using LLM for color using Json file.
